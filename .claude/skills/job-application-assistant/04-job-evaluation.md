# Job Evaluation Framework

<!-- SETUP: Skill match areas and career goals are personalized by running /setup -->

## Scoring Dimensions

Evaluate each job posting against these five dimensions:

### 1. Technical Skills Match (0-100)
How well do the required/preferred skills align with the candidate's capabilities?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Core requirements are primary skills |
| 60-79 | Most requirements match, 1-2 gaps that are learnable |
| 40-59 | Partial match, significant upskilling needed |
| 0-39 | Fundamental mismatch |

**Strong match areas:** Full-stack Java (Spring/Spring Boot/Hibernate) + React/TypeScript; RESTful API design; Agile/DevOps environments; regulated/compliance-heavy domains (federal compliance, audited manufacturing traceability)
**Moderate match areas:** Python, GraphQL, C++; cloud infrastructure (AWS, Docker, Terraform); technical/informal leadership and mentoring
**Weak match areas:** Formal people-management (no direct-report experience); data science/ML; roles requiring security clearance or defense-sector work (also a deal-breaker, see below)

### 2. Experience Match (0-100)
Does work history align with what they're looking for?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Direct experience in the same domain and role type |
| 60-79 | Related experience, transferable skills clear |
| 40-59 | Adjacent experience, would need to make the case |
| 0-39 | Unrelated experience |

**Strong:** Enterprise full-stack engineering in regulated/audited domains (federal ESA compliance tooling, manufacturing traceability systems); government contracting
**Moderate:** Client-facing consulting delivery (Slalom); infrastructure/legacy modernization and production support
**Entry-level:** Formal engineering management or Tech Lead titles (has driven Agile transformation and culture change informally, but not held the formal title)

### 3. Behavioral/Culture Fit (0-100)
Does the role and company culture match the behavioral profile?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Culture strongly matches behavioral preferences |
| 60-79 | Mixed signals but mostly compatible |
| 40-59 | Some friction areas |
| 0-39 | Significant culture mismatch |

**Red flags to research:** Department disorganization, work dominated by maintenance over development, poor chemistry with leadership, culture mismatches. Check reviews, media coverage, LinkedIn connections, and network contacts for insider perspective.

### 4. Location & Logistics (Pass/Fail + Notes)
- Fully remote: PASS (strongly preferred)
- Hybrid within the Denver, CO metro area (Loveland/Fort Collins/Denver/Boulder): PASS (acceptable backup)
- Onsite/hybrid outside the Denver metro area: FAIL
- Requires relocation: FAIL (deal-breaker)
- Frequent travel: FLAG (discuss with user)
- Defense/defense-contractor employer: FAIL (deal-breaker, regardless of location)

### 5. Career Alignment & Motivation (0-100)
Does this role advance career goals and contain tasks that energize?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Strongly aligned with career direction, clear growth path |
| 60-79 | Good role but only partially aligned with long-term goals |
| 40-59 | Decent job but doesn't build toward career goals |
| 0-39 | Dead end or backwards step |

**Career goals:**
- Grow into Senior/Staff Full Stack Engineer roles
- Seek out greenfield builds and legacy-modernization work rather than pure maintenance
- Move toward roles that value driving team culture and trust, not just raw IC output

**Motivation filter:** Evaluate not just whether you *can* do the tasks, but whether the tasks will *energize* you. Consider:
- Tasks that energize: Greenfield builds (0-to-1); fixing team dysfunction/culture change; modernizing legacy systems
- Tasks that drain: Heavy on-call/production-firefighting-centric roles; low-trust or toxic team cultures
- Non-task factors: remote-first autonomy, trust-based (not command-and-control) leadership

**Life situation alignment:** Consider personal constraints:
- **Security**: Currently between roles and actively searching - no other stated financial constraints
- **Flexibility**: Requires fully remote work, or hybrid limited to the Denver, CO metro area; not open to relocation
- **Professional development**: Prioritizing growth toward senior/staff IC scope, or roles with the informal tech-lead/culture-change scope he's already demonstrated

**Target sectors (from `/setup`):** Productivity/task-management tools (e.g. Todoist, Toggl), space industry, conservation/environmental organizations, outdoor/recreation tech (e.g. AllTrails)

**Deal-breakers (hard screen):**
- Not fully remote and not hybrid within the Denver, CO metro area
- Defense/defense-contractor employers
- Roles centered on heavy on-call/production firefighting
- Toxic or low-trust team cultures (screen via reviews/network where possible)

### 6. Salary Benchmark (Optional)

If the salary lookup tool is configured (`salary_data.json` exists), look up the company:
```
python salary_lookup.py "<Company Name>" --json
```

If a city is known from the posting, add `--city "<City>"` to narrow results.

Present findings as:
```
### Salary Benchmark
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [Category] index | XX.X (+/-X.X% vs baseline) |
| Overall index | XX.X (+/-X.X% vs baseline) |
```

Interpret results relative to the baseline defined in the data file's metadata. For index-based data, higher typically means above-market compensation.

If the salary tool is not configured, skip this section.

## Output Format

Present the evaluation as:

```
## Job Fit Evaluation: [Role] at [Company]

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Technical Skills | XX/100 | [brief note] |
| Experience Match | XX/100 | [brief note] |
| Behavioral Fit | XX/100 | [brief note] |

| Career Alignment | XX/100 | [brief note] |

**Overall Score: XX/100** (weighted average of scored dimensions)

(Location is pass/fail, not weighted)

## Thresholds
- **Strong Fit** (75+): Definitely apply, tailor everything
- **Good Fit** (60-74): Apply, address gaps in cover letter
- **Moderate Fit** (45-59): Consider carefully, discuss with user
- **Weak Fit** (30-44): Probably skip unless strategic reasons
- **Poor Fit** (<30): Skip

## Pre-Application: Call the Employer (Best Practice)

Before writing the application, consider whether the candidate should call the contact person listed in the posting. **Only call if there are substantive questions** - never call just to "be remembered."

### When to Suggest Calling
- The posting has unclear or ambiguous requirements
- It's unclear which competencies are essential vs. nice-to-have
- The role description is vague about day-to-day tasks
- There's a named contact person who invites questions

### Good Questions to Ask
- "What are the primary challenges in this role?"
- "How is time typically divided across the listed responsibilities?"
- "Which competencies are most critical for success in this position?"
- "What does success look like in the first 6-12 months?"

### Rules for the Call
- Prepare a 30-second "elevator pitch" about your background in case they ask
- The call's purpose is **gathering information**, not delivering a pitch
- Take notes - use what you learn to tailor the application
- Reference the conversation naturally in the cover letter ("After speaking with [name], I was especially drawn to...")
